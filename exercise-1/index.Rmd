### Exercise 1 ###

library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)

# Store a variable "movie"
movie <- "Kill Bill"
# Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
  movie <- gsub(" ", "+", movie)
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # See the interactive console for more detail:https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
  base <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?"
  api.key <- "&api-key=bc10c3e40ce042fb8bffbdbd77fa3c44"
  movie <- paste0("query=", movie, api.key)
  url <- paste0(base, movie)
  # Request data using your search query
  request <- fromJSON(url)

  # What type of variable does this return?
  
  # Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  data <- flatten(request$results)
  
  # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article each in their own variables
  recent.review <- data[1,]
  headline <- recent.review$headline
  summary <- recent.review$summary_short
  link <- recent.review$link.url
  # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above
  return(list(headline, summary, link))
}
# Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing your movie to your GetReview function
movie.info <- GetReview(movie)
```
# `r movie`
## `r movie.info[1]`
> `r movie.info[2]` 

`r movie.info[3]`
